	print("""Answer-
		An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions.
		Expressions need to be evaluated. If you ask Python to print an expression,
		the interpreter evaluates the expression and displays the result..

		A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute.
		We have only seen the assignment statement so far. Some other kinds of statements..
		while statements, for statements, if statements, and import statements.""")

	# Example:
	n = 4*5+20-40										# Is an Expression
	n = "iNeuron Enroll Course"							# Is a statement
	print("\nFull Stack Data Science 2.0")				# Is an Expression statement
